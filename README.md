# Resume Parsing with SpaCy and Named Entity Recognition (NER)

## Project Overview

This project focuses on parsing resumes using SpaCy, a powerful natural language processing (NLP) library, with a specific emphasis on Named Entity Recognition (NER). NER helps identify and classify entities in text into predefined categories such as names of persons, organizations, locations, dates, etc. By leveraging NER, we can extract valuable information from resumes efficiently.

### Functionality

The key functionalities of this project include:

1. **Resume Parsing**: Extracting structured information from resumes.
2. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities within the resume text.
3. **Information Extraction**: Extracting specific information such as candidate names, contact details, skills, experience, education, etc.
4. **Data Structuring**: Organizing extracted information into a structured format for further processing or analysis.
5. **Integration**: Ability to integrate with existing systems or databases for seamless workflow.

## Approach

### Dataset

We may use a diverse dataset of resumes in various formats (PDF, Word, etc.) to train and test the parsing system.

### NER with SpaCy

SpaCy offers pre-trained models for NER, which we can fine-tune based on our specific requirements. We will leverage these models to identify entities within the resume text accurately.

### Resume Parsing Pipeline

1. **Preprocessing**: Convert resumes into text format and perform necessary preprocessing steps (e.g., removing headers/footers, standardizing formats).
2. **NER**: Apply SpaCy's NER model to identify entities such as names, organizations, skills, etc.
3. **Information Extraction**: Extract relevant information based on identified entities and their context.
4. **Data Structuring**: Organize extracted information into a structured format (e.g., JSON, CSV) for easy access and analysis.
